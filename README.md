# Restaurant Getter 🍔🍛

This simple React app will be a proof of concept.
Its aims are:
- Take the following data as inputs:
  - User location
  - A radius in km
- Perform a fetch call to the YELP API to retrieve restaurants in the specified radius around the specified location
- Render these results

Initially location will be manually entered as latitude and longitude. Then I'll attempt to use other data such as a postcode or address, and then I'll attempt to use device data.
